# Nagios XI Create Passive Object
* This output watches the Nagios Core log data for messages about objects that don't exist
 * Error: Got host checkresult for 'centos01', but no such host can be found
 * Error: Got check result for service 'New Service' on host 'centos01'. Unable to find service

* When these messages are detected, the box293_xi_api_create_passive_object.php script is executed on the Nagios Log Server, it will:
 * Create a new passive Host Object on your Nagios XI server if it is a passive Host checkresult message
 * Create a new passive Service Object on Nagios XI server if it is a passive Service checkresult message
  * If the host object for this service does not exist then it will also be created
* The purpose of this output it to automate the creation of the passive host and service objects in Nagios XI

* About the passive objects created on your Nagios XI server
 * In Nagios XI, when check results are received from a host or service that do not exist they are added to the "Unconfigured Objects" list
  * Admin > Monitoring Config > Unconfigured Objects
 * You can turn these unconfigured objects into hosts and services by running the "Unconfigured Passive Object" Configuration Wizard
  * The passive objects created by the box293_xi_api_create_passive_object.php script are identical to how the wizard creates them

* The box293_xi_api_create_passive_object.php script can be downloaded from:
 * https://raw.githubusercontent.com/T-M-D/NXI-Collection/master/API/box293_xi_api_create_passive_object.php
 * It needs to be placed into the /usr/local/nagioslogserver/scripts/ directory

* This output relies on the Nagios Core Filter which can be downloaded here:
 * https://raw.githubusercontent.com/T-M-D/NLS-Collection/master/Filters/Nagios_Core.txt
 * Full instructions are at the top of the file

* Administration > Global Configuration > Show Outputs > Add Output
 * Your Nagios XI server address (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx) will need to be defined in the "command" lines below
 * Your Nagios XI API Key (your_api_key) will need to be defined in the "command" lines below

* The remaining text below is what needs to be added to Nagios Log Server as an input
